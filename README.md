# Kustomize: Zero to Hero üöÄ

This project demonstrates how to use **Kustomize** to manage and customize Kubernetes YAML configurations for different environments like **development**, **staging**, and **production** ‚Äî without duplicating code.

---

## üìö What is Kustomize?

**Kustomize** is a Kubernetes-native configuration management tool that lets you:

Kustomize helps you change Kubernetes files without editing them directly. Think of it like cooking:
- You have a basic recipe (we call this the base)
- You want to make small changes (we call these overlays)
- You don't need to change the original recipe!

It works directly with `kubectl` ‚Äî no extra tools required!

```

## Understanding the Files

### Base Configuration
The `base/` directory contains your original, unchanged configuration:
- `deployment.yaml`: A simple nginx web server deployment
- `kustomization.yaml`: Lists which files to include

### Overlay Configuration
The `overlay/` directory shows how to customize the base:
- Adds a prefix to all resources (`dev-`)
- Updates the nginx image version to 1.20
- Adds environment labels

## Try It Yourself


### üîπ base/
Contains the default (common) Kubernetes manifests ‚Äî shared by all environments.

### üîπ overlays/development/
Contains environment-specific customizations (for development in this case).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- ‚úÖ Access to a Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube, OKE, EKS, etc.)

> Kustomize is built-in with `kubectl` (v1.14+)

---

## üß™ How to Run and Test

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 1. See the Base Manifest Output

```bash
kubectl kustomize ./base
```

1. View the base deployment:
```bash
kubectl kustomize base/
```

2. View the customized version:
```bash
kubectl kustomize overlay/
```

3. Apply to your cluster:
```bash
kubectl apply -k overlay/
```

## What's Happening?
1. Kustomize reads the base configuration
2. It applies the changes specified in the overlay:
   - Adds "dev-" prefix to names
   - Updates the nginx image
   - Adds environment labels
3. Generates the final configuration

## Key Concepts
- **Base**: Your original configuration
- **Overlay**: Your customizations
- **kustomization.yaml**: Tells Kustomize what to do
- **Resources**: The Kubernetes files you want to modify
